This repository contain tensorflow basics to intermediate level.

Regression Problem :-

1. The data file name id housing_price.csv :

Here are some info about data :

The Features:

housingMedianAge: continuous.
totalRooms: continuous.
totalBedrooms: continuous.
population: continuous.
households: continuous.
medianIncome: continuous.
medianHouseValue: continuous.

2. Classification Problem :-

The data is available in git repository as Census_data.


3. Image Detection using CNN.

  I am using cifer data and can be downloaded from https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~kriz/cifar-10-python.tar.gz
  if we see there are 10 batches and each batch contains 10000 samples

  label_names : airplane,automobile,bird,cat,deer,dog,frog,horse,ship,truck'
  num_cases_per_batch : 10000
  num_vis : 3072
  
4. WordEmbedding , sentiment analysis using RNN :

  I am using RNN in Tensorflow.
  The data is ImdbReviews.tar.gz
  I am using a basic LSTM concept to train a Seq2Seq Model on word vector and figure out the test accuracy.
